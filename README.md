# Carg: C with better arguments

basically C but you can return multiple values from a function, and there is *better* runtime errors.

# Basic Usage
- Run `python src/main.py examples/different/types.carg` to "compile" the .carg to .c
- then run `gcc test.c` or whatever compiler you want
- then run `a.exe` or `./a` depending on your OS.
- Try modifying test.carg with some new code, then repeat this process ^
